# Vibe Coding Empire

This is a simple **[idle game](https://redd.it/ufyni2)**. The goal of the game is, of course, to make as much money as possible. You start as a solo founder, founding your Vibe Coding company. You have a bit of pocket change and with that you hire your first **intern engineer**. With that intern you start making more money ( your profit per second will increase drastically ) and soon you will be able to hire a **junior software engineer**, then a **senior developer**, and so on...

Ironically this game has been generated using **[vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding)** trough Bolt DOT new (during a hacking contest).

Here's the prompt used to make this game:

> Build me a idle game where you are a coder and you are building Vibe Coding platforms and you are convincing other people to vibe code without knowing how to code. You will have to have something that looks an office and other employees working for you and the more money you make the more employees you will hire.
